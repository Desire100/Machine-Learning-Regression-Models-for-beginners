# Regression-Models-Templates
In this repository I have shared the different machine learning regression models templates such as Simple, Multi_ linear regression and polynomial regression and the datasets to train &amp; test these models.

please use the datasets Salary_Data, 50_Startups, Position_Salaries to train and test your simple_linear_regression, Multiple_linear_regression and Polynomial_Linear_regression respectively.

Here is the description of each dataset:

1. Salary_Data: this dataset explains the description of business problem. we have two columns where the first columns is to the years of experience and the second column contains their corresponding salaries.
                 what the company is asking to do is to find out if there is any sort of correlation in salary and years of experiences. and try to predict the salary of the new employee based on his/her years of experinces.
